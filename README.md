# Esp 8266 Video Series

Notes, code and details for my esp8266 videos

# An Introduction

The Esp 8266 is a chip used in a family of modules which make it quite simple to make small and lower power devices that can connect to the internet with Wi-Fi. It can run user code, and has a number of inputs and outputs to attach sensors and devices.

# Plans

I have plans to build robots with it - but I've started with some simple demos. 
Among the things I'd like to build:
* a robot based on 2 modified servo's with a phone as a controller.
* A crawler potentially using muscle wire
* A wifi buffering extension for my CnC with a Raspberry Pi backend.
* 8266 based armbot - possibly using 2 together in unison.
* Small cluster of cheap meshed robots - taking one as an AP with the rest as clients to it.

# What I am doing currently

Beyond collecting up my notes so the videos make more sense, I've been trying out the esp12 and esp03 modules - which have more pins for inputs and outputs than the esp01, and I've ordered a few other esp kits online for fun - including some rather neat DIP based modules with on board regulators, USB input and USB to Serial converters. When they are the same price as the esp-01, they make it far easier to experiment.

I've also been attempting to put Micropython on them. Videos and demos to follow.
