# Introduction

This is an esp8266/NodeMCU based robot with 2 wheels that is both inexpensive, and a starting platform for fun and experimentation.

# Bill Of Materials

* Robot Chassis - many on ebay as "smart robot chassis". These are extremely cheap, you shouldn't pay more than about Â£15 for it. It should have:
** The main chassis - some precut perspex.
** 2 motors with wheels - preferably with cables soldered on.
** A front castor.
** All fixing screws.
* It may have:
** Encoder slots and wheels
* If the chassis didn't come with one, you need a 4xAA battery box.
* 4xAA batteries
* SOme sticky tack, or double sided sticky pads.
* A NodeMCU dev board module.
* an L298N motor control module - there are designs that jumper the enable pins so they are pulled up - for the current build, remove this jumper.
* A breadboard
* Some breadboard jump wires - of varying lengths - get a selection of these.
* 8 male to female jump wires with crimped ends.

# Building it

First - remove any backing from the perspex chassis.

If the motors didn't come wired then solder the wires on before the next step.

Bolt the motors onto the chassis.
Fix the wheels onto the motors.
Bolt the castor onto the chassis too.
